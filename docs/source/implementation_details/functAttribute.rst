functAttribute
==============

The functAttribute class is derived from NDAttribute. It obtains its value from a user-written C++ function. The functAttribute class is thus very general, and can be used to add almost any information to an NDArray. ADCore contains example code, myAttributeFunctions.cpp that demonstates how to write such functions. The `functAttribute class documentation <http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/classfunct_attribute.html>`_ describes this class in detail.
