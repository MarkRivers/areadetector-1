paramAttribute
==============

The paramAttribute class is derived from NDAttribute. It obtains its value from the current value of a driver or plugin parameter. The paramAttribute class is typically used when it is important to have the current value of the parameter and the value of a corresponding PVAttribute might not be current because the EPICS PV has not yet updated. The `paramAttribute class documentation <http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/classparam_attribute.html>`_ describes this class in detail.
