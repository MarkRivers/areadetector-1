PVAttribute
===========

The PVAttribute class is derived from NDAttribute. It obtains its value by monitor callbacks from an EPICS PV, and is thus used to associate current the value of any EPICS PV with an NDArray. The `PVAttribute class documentation <http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_p_v_attribute.html>`_ describes this class in detail.
